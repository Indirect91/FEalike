Thank you for downloading my FEW Models. 

To catch you up to speed what you might need to know is the following:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Armorbreak face texture is the same as the base costume. Use the textures included in the base.

* Blender might not be so kind to the FBX's. Using Bos FBX importer, or trying to import the FBX through other means will probably end up working better. I have guides in my
submission to help.

* The Hairref mesh on the hairs of model uses the texture and Opacity from the face. I noticed many people deleting them, so I felt I needed to make a note on it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mesh has been modified slightly to just be a little better. Things patched up and polished, as well as Physic Mesh's rigged to a custom set of bones. Basically it has a
reduced amount of chao's that otherwise woulnd't be noticable. 

If any problems accure like major rigging issues or mesh problems, please let "KuroKairaku" know.
